## Flagship Project — VelvetDesk AI Receptionist

Production AI voice receptionist platform for SMBs — built and delivered end-to-end, solo.

The system handles inbound calls, books appointments in real time, manages rescheduling and cancellations, and syncs with Google Calendar — without human intervention.

**Stack:** Next.js 15 · TypeScript · Supabase · VAPI · Claude AI · Google Calendar · LemonSqueezy  
**Timeline:** Zero to production in under 12 months  
**Outcome:** Launched, demonstrated to investors, formally handed over — without operational or reputational issues

## How I Work with AI

- Outcome-first, not model-first
- Human-in-the-loop by design
- Governance and documentation before scale
- Explainability before deployment
- Clear exit and handover strategy

## Background

20+ years at the board-adjacent level in corporate reputation, crisis communications, and high-stakes stakeholder management — IPO preparation (USD 4B+), major M&A (USD 8B), cross-border GR.

That experience shapes how I approach AI delivery: risk-aware, governance-friendly, and with full awareness of reputational consequences.
